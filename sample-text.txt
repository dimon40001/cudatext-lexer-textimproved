Text IMproved Styles Introduction

Text IMproved lexer for CudaText text editor (indentation-based folding and syntax highlight).

SECTION 1: COMMON STYLES

    This is a regular text style with @Annotation and // single-line comments support
    
    Text main contain "double quoted strings", 'single quoted strings', `reverse quoted string similar to Markdown code`
    
    Symbols of non-alphabet nature are higlighted:
        punctuation ,.?!
        also brackets [](){}<>
        and virtually !@#$%^&*-_+/|\`~"' every other symbol.
    
    Any line starting with "---" or "===" is 
    --- considered a separator (similar to YAML)
    to make logical separation
        and increase visibility without
        === affecting the code tree and folding
    
    Abbreviations (or captions or all-capitals words) ARE also _RECOGNIZED_AND_HIGLIGHTED
    
    Number support is provided for a range of formats:
        integer 42
        floating point 3.14 or 2,71 using dot or comma
        posistive +36.6 and negative -273,15 values
        hexadecimal values are recognized as well 0xFFFF
        there is no special highlight for binary or octal numbers
    
    Browser web-links http://github.com are highlighted by CudaText engine automatically.
    (If `links_hilite` option is enabled in configuration).

SECTION 2: USING INDENTATION

    Code tree is built automatically based on the indentation (tabs or 4 spaces).
    
    There are 3 ways to exclude a line from being rendered in the code tree (can be used to avoid clutter):
        . start a line with the "dot"
        - start a line with the "dash"
         using uneven indentation (5, 6, 7 spaces) should also do the trick

    For improved readability list items can be separated with blank lines or separators:
        Logical group 1 item 1
        Logical group 1 item 2
        
        Logical group 2 item A 
        Logical group 2 item B 
        --- here separator is used instead of blank line
        Logical group 3 item I 
        Logical group 3 item II
    
    This
        is
            example
            of
                multi
        level
        indentation of `plain` text.
        
    @Any style
        "can also" be used
            / as block start 
                2.16 even numbers
                    --- but not the separators
                // however comments
                and
                    `backquotes` 
                        and
                    ALL_CAPITALS
                        and
                    ' unpaired quotes are regognized   
                    displayed
            in code
        tree.
